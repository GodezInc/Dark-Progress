##Dark Progress

Thanks to [Jeff Broderick](http://twitter.com/brdrck) for making the [PSD](http://drbl.in/bhEM) free for all!

It is resolution independent, as you can see with [@2x](http://nckplsn.me/6U64) and [@3x](http://nckplsn.me/6Tq8).

Core Graphics is used so that it could be maybe converted to iOS in the future, and to further familiarize myself with Core Graphics.

This is overall a proof of concept, to see that it can be done.  *It is not optimized in any way.*

Please feel free to make it better and submit a pull request!
